## :hammer_and_wrench: Experience

### [OZON](https://www.ozon.ru)
2021 – present

During the second year of study at Higher School of Economics, I did an internship at OZON.ru, a big Russian e-commerce company.

I worked in a team of software developers and analysts and participated in the development and maintenance of the back-end of the
software used by Order Delivery Points (website & SQL database) using CI/CD practices.

The software I helped maintain and develop used the microservice architecture model and was programmed using C#’s .NET 5 Framework
and utilized PostgreSQL (with C#’s EntityFramework) and MS SQL as its databases.

During the 6 months of internship, I regularly used Jira for task management and tools such as Graylog, Grafana and Jaeger for
tracking bugs and assuring the stability of our services.

Continued working there as an employee after the internship.
